     * {@return a string representation of the object}
     * <p>
     * Satisfying this method's contract implies a non-{@code null}
     * result must be returned.
     *
     * @apiNote In general, the
     * {@code toString} method returns a string that
     * "textually represents" this object. The result should
     * be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a
     * person to read.
     * It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
     * The string output is not necessarily stable over time or across
     * JVM invocations.
     * @implSpec The {@code toString} method for class {@code Object}
     * returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
     * object is an instance, the at-sign character `{@code @}', and
     * the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
     * object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
     * value of:
     * {@snippet lang = java:
     * getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
     *}
     * The {@link Objects#toIdentityString(Object)
     * Objects.toIdentityString} method returns the string for an
     * object equal to the string that would be returned if neither
     * the {@code toString} nor {@code hashCode} methods were
     * overridden by the object's class.
